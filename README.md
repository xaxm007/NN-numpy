# NN-Numpy

An implementation of a simple neural network using NumPy, focusing on logistic regression and calculus-based derivations.

## Overview

This neural network has two layers:
- **Input Layer:** 3 units
- **Hidden Layer:** 4 units
- **Output Layer:** 1 unit

The project demonstrates the use of NumPy for building and training a neural network from scratch, without relying on external machine learning libraries. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xaxm007/NN-numpy.git
2. Navigate to project directory:
    ```bash
    cd NN-numpy
    pip install numpy
3. To train the neural network, run the main script:
    ```bash
    python LogisticRegression.py
